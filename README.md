Repo of replication materials for "Explaining Recruitment to Extremism: A Bayesian Hierarchical Case-Control Approach." This is the final version control repository without data output (too large for Github). For full replication dataverse, see: <INSERT HARVARD DATAVERSE URL>.

## Description of data

We use three main sources of data. These are all in the folder "data/".

1. The principal raw data come leaked recruitment records. These are provided (with names, address etc.) as "master_data.csv."
2. There are then three data sets of recruitment records merged with survey and administrative data. For all countries, this file is "matchadata_isisall.csv"; for Egypt "matchdata_isisegysc.csv"; and for Tunisia "matchdata_isistunsc.csv".
3. The final dataset, "mena_pops.csv" is a list of population figures needed for the estimation procedure.
